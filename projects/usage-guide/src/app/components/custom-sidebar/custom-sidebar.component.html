<div class="card card-w-title">
    <p>
        This is a custom sidebar.
        It is implemented outside of the navigation module, but is assigned to an internal content slot
        by assigning its <code>ngTemplateOutlet</code> to this component's <code>TemplateRef</code>.
        This is triggered in response to the activation of a specific route in the menu hierarchy.

        So, now you know.
